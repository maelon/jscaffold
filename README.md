## A spa webpack scaffold with asynchronous modules loading

This tool just likes vue-cli, but with new feature: asynchronous modules loading.

### installation

npm install -g jscaffold

> be aware:
> node >= 4.0.0 required

### usage

* jscaffold init <tempate-name> <project-name>

`tempate-name`: now just webpack, more template coming soon
`project-name`: blank project name will create project in current directory, or will creat a named directory.

* jscaffold list 

This will list the templates available.
